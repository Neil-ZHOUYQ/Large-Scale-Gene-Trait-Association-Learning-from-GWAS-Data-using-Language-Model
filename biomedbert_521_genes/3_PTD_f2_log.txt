Some weights of BertModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /mnt/home/zhouyuqi/bert02/out/nlp/biomedbert/DAP/250508_022350_E9_B32_LR2e-05_WD0.01 and are newly initialized: ['pooler.dense.bias', 'pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
